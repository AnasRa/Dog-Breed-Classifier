# Dog-Breed-Classifier

This project was part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodgree and I learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images.
Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
